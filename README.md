**Ticketmatch is my CS50 final project:** an online marketplace where college students can resell/purchase event tickets and/or coordinate rideshares.

**To run the app locally,** download the app directory and run "flask run" in VSCode (or another IDE).

**To access the app via the deployment link,** visit [ticket-match.herokuapp.com](ticket-match.herokuapp.com).

**Site features** include a searchable and sortable database for tickets and rides, options to post sale items, options to submit purchase offers, user transaction profiles, and user login/registration. Any user can view and search sale items on the app's home page (as well as the ticket and rideshare specific pages). Search results can also be sorted by event name, date, time, price, and location. 

In order to post sale items or submit purchase offers, users must log in to an existing account or register for an account. Registration requires a unique username and password, but users will remain logged in once succesfully completing the registration and/or login process. 

Once logged in, users can view their unique profiles, which displays a history of their transactions (both sales and purchases). Selling a ticket or rideshare requires specifying information like quantity, event name, date, time, location, and price. All sale items show up on the home page and disappear once the event date has passed.
